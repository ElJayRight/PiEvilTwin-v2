Going to stop building the GUI and instead build out a cli version. Wanting to port everything from cli to gui eventually.
---
The CLI version is now as good as the GUI.
Still need to add WPA2 support.

Fixed bug in main (forgot what it was), also found a bug with the starting ssid and mac addr. Easy fix just lazy

Need to change the logic of writing the mac addr and ssid, this should be done before the AP is started.

Should use sed for replace with the config files.
Think it would be cool to add a feature to save scanned AP's and then be able to clone them later on, passive scanning mode? Might also add geo tagging. (ethical?)

Added wpa2 password.
---
Don't really want to use sed as I'm going to need to sanitise a bunch of inputs.

Should restructure a the menu for when the app is running.
